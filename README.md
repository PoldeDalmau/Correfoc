# Correfoc
This is my first WebGL project using [Three.js](https://threejs.org/). I'm aiming to create a lively crowd of demons celebrating the Correfoc, a fiery Catalan and Valencian tradition where demons wield explosive pitchforks in a pyrotechnic parade. The plan is to animate a few mischievous demons leading the pack, pitchforks ablaze, and—just for fun—occasionally aiming them at people's feet.

I have incorporated autonomous agents that can follow a path using [YUKA](https://mugen87.github.io/yuka/), a JavaScript library for developing Game AI. In addition, the agents wander around the entity that follows the path to make it look like a chaotic crowd is following a set path around the town. A navigation mesh is used to ensure the agents do not access restricted areas such as buildings, cars, etc.
