# Correfoc
This is my first WebGL project using Three.js. I want to make a little crowd of demons celebrating the correfoc, a Catalan and Valencian tradition, where folks dress up as demons and engage in a pyrotechnical spectacle. The goal is to make a couple demons holding an explosive pitchfork, and having the crowd follow them around the city.
